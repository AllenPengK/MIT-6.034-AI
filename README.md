# Demonstrations
Much of the material in 6.034 is reinforced by on-line artificial-intelligence demonstrations developed by us or otherwise available on the web. Those demonstrations developed by us are provided via the easy-to-use Java Web Start mechanism, which comes with the Java Runtime Environment, the so-called JRE.

The demonstrations illustrate the following ideas:

* Blocks world manipulation (after Winograd)
* Search: depth-first, breadth-first, hill-climbing, beam, branch and bound, A*
* Games: mini-max, alpha-beta
* Genetic algorithms: crossover, mutation, fitness
* Constraint satisfaction: drawing analysis (after Waltz, using Huffman labels)
* Domain reduction: map coloring, resource allocation
* Biological mimetics: genetic algorithms, self-organizing maps, cross-modal clustering
* Learning: nearest neighbors, support vector machines, lattice learning, boosting

So, if you don't have the Java Runtime Environment installed, you should [install it first](http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/). Then, you can [run the demonstrations (JNLP)](run the demonstrations (JNLP).).
